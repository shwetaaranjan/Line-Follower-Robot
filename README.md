# Line-Follower-Robot
Project Title
Line Following Robot with Arduino and Python

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Python to communicate with an Arduino-based robot via serial communication. The Python script sends commands to control the motors of the robot, while the Arduino reads input from IR sensors and sends sensor data back to Python for processing.

Features
Serial communication: Communication between Python and Arduino using the serial port.
Motor control: Python can send commands to control the forward/backward movement and turning of the robot.
Sensor data reading: Python reads sensor data from the Arduino, which is used to make decisions for controlling the robot's movement.
Hardware Requirements
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Nano)
IR Sensors (for line detection)
DC Motors (for robot movement)
Motor Driver (e.g., L298N or L293D)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
External Power Supply for Arduino and motors
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE: To upload the Arduino code to the board.
Python: The Python code can be run on any system with Python 3.x installed.
pySerial Library: Python library for serial communication.
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/line-following-robot.git
Install Python dependencies: To install the necessary Python package, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyserial
Arduino Setup:

Open the Arduino IDE and upload the Arduino code (located in the arduino_code directory) to your Arduino board.
Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB.
Running the Python Code:

Modify the COM3 port in the Python script (python_code/serial_comm.py) to the correct port where your Arduino is connected.
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python serial_comm.py
Usage
The Python script will read sensor data from the Arduino and send commands to control the robot's movement.
Ensure the Arduino is connected and the correct serial port is specified in the Python code before running it.
